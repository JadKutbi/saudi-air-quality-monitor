Traditional Air Quality Index (AQI) is designed for ground-level monitoring stations that measure air at breathing height in ppb/ppm units.

Sentinel-5P satellite data measures **total column density** (mmol/m²) - the total amount of a gas in the entire atmospheric column from ground to space. These values cannot be directly converted to ground-level AQI.

**This Satellite Pollution Index shows:**
- Percentage of calibrated thresholds for industrial monitoring
- Categories based on Sentinel-5P typical ranges
- Health guidance appropriate for satellite-detected pollution events""",

مؤشر جودة الهواء التقليدي (AQI) مصمم لمحطات المراقبة الأرضية التي تقيس الهواء على مستوى التنفس بوحدات ppb/ppm.

بيانات القمر الصناعي Sentinel-5P تقيس **الكثافة العمودية الإجمالية** (mmol/m²) - الكمية الإجمالية للغاز في العمود الجوي بأكمله من الأرض إلى الفضاء. لا يمكن تحويل هذه القيم مباشرة إلى مؤشر جودة الهواء الأرضي.

**يُظهر مؤشر التلوث الفضائي:**
- نسبة مئوية من الحدود المعايرة للمراقبة الصناعية
- فئات بناءً على النطاقات النموذجية لـ Sentinel-5P
- إرشادات صحية مناسبة لأحداث التلوث المكتشفة بالأقمار الصناعية""",
